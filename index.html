      <h2>My Lore</h2>
      <p id="quote">Every developer embarks on a journey of learning and growth. Here are the key quests that have shaped my path as a full-stack JavaScript developer.</p>
      <p>My journey into software development began with a spark—video games, especially those created by Nintendo. Their creativity and innovation inspired me to explore programming and learn how to bring ideas to life through code.</p>
      <p>Now, I’m working toward becoming a full-stack JavaScript developer, focusing on building dynamic interfaces with React and robust backends with Node.js. This portfolio is where I share my progress, showcase my skills, and demonstrate my passion for crafting complete, functional applications.</p>

Driven by curiosity, I started learning basic programming concepts, beginning with Java, the language that introduced me to the craft of coding.</p>
